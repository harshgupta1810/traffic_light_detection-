# traffic light Detection README.md

This README.md file provides an overview and explanation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection code created by Harsh Gupta (Desparete Enuf). The code uses the YOLOv3 model to detect objects in a video and draw bounding boxes around them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the YOLO Object Detection code, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system.

### Model and Configuration Files

Download the YOLOv3 model weights file and configuration file from the official YOLO website or a reliable source. Place the files in the same directory as the code.

### Running the YOLO Object Detection

1. Clone or download the repository containing the YOLO Object Detection code.
2. Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
3. Download the YOLOv3 model weights and configuration files and place them in the same directory as the code.
4. Run the Python script, and a window will open showing the object detection on the video.

## Code Description

The YOLO Object Detection code uses the YOLOv3 model for object detection. It performs the following steps:

1. Loads the YOLOv3 model with the pre-trained weights and configuration file.
2. Reads frames from a video file (test.mp4) using OpenCV.
3. Processes each frame to detect objects using YOLOv3.
4. Draws bounding boxes around the detected objects and displays the frame in a window.
5. Writes the processed frames with bounding boxes to an output video file (output.mp4).

## Functionality

The YOLO Object Detection code allows you to:

- Perform real-time object detection on a video file (test.mp4).
- Draw bounding boxes around detected objects and display the video in a window.
- Save the processed video with bounding boxes to an output file (output.mp4).

# YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) Object Detection

YOLOv3, short for You Only Look Once version 3, is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. It is an extension of its predecessors, YOLO and YOLOv2 (YOLO9000). YOLOv3 is known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.

## What is Object Detection?

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image or video. The goal is to recognize and classify objects present in the scene and draw bounding boxes around them.

## How YOLOv3 Works?

YOLOv3 employs a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Unlike traditional object detection methods that use region proposal algorithms to identify candidate object locations, YOLOv3 takes a different approach:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: YOLOv3 divides the input image into a grid of cells and each cell is responsible for predicting a fixed number of bounding boxes.

2. **Anchor Boxes**: The model uses anchor boxes of different sizes and aspect ratios to predict bounding boxes for various object shapes. Each anchor box is associated with a specific object scale.

3. **Class Prediction**: YOLOv3 predicts the class probabilities for each bounding box. It can detect multiple object classes simultaneously.

4. **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: After predictions, YOLOv3 applies NMS to remove duplicate detections and keep the most confident ones.

## Why YOLOv3?

The advantages of YOLOv3 over other object detection algorithms include:

1. **Speed**: YOLOv3 is faster than many traditional methods and can process real-time video streams efficiently.

2. **Single Pass**: YOLOv3 processes the entire image in a single forward pass through the neural network, making it more efficient and straightforward.

3. **Flexibility**: YOLOv3 can detect a wide range of objects across different classes and scales due to the use of anchor boxes.

4. **Accuracy**: YOLOv3 achieves competitive accuracy compared to other object detection models, making it suitable for various real-world applications.


## Configuration Parameters

- 'yolov3_training_last.weights': Path to the YOLOv3 model weights file.
- 'yolov3_testing.cfg': Path to the YOLOv3 configuration file.
- 'classes': List of class labels for the detected objects. The current implementation uses an empty list; replace it with the appropriate class labels for your specific use case.
